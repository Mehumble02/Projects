Arsinoe, a naturalist, is said to have the ability to bloom the reddest rose and control the fiercest of lions.But becoming the Queen Crowned isnt solely a matter of royal birth. Each sister has to fight for it. And its not just a game of win or lose…its life or death. The night the sisters turn sixteen, the battle begins. The last queen standing gets the crown.'
